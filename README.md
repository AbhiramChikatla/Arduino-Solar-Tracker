# Arduino-Solar-Tracker
An Arduino solar tracker is a device that uses an Arduino microcontroller to automatically orient a solar panel or solar cell array towards the sun throughout the day. This tracking system optimizes solar energy capture by ensuring that the solar panels are always facing the sun, thus increasing energy efficiency and overall power output.
